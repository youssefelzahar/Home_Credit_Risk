Home Credit Risk Prediction

Welcome to the Home Credit Risk Prediction repository! This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the probability of a client defaulting on a loan, using historical application data. The goal is to assist financial institutions in assessing loan eligibility and minimizing credit risk.

Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict loan default risk. By leveraging historical data, the model helps lenders make informed decisions. The repository includes the following:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Model training and evaluation.

Hyperparameter tuning for optimization.

Features

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.

Feature Engineering: Generate meaningful features from raw data.

Model Development: Train and test multiple machine learning models.

Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics like AUC, accuracy, and F1-score to assess performance.

Visualization: Insightful plots for better understanding of the data and model results.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle's Home Credit Default Risk competition. It includes the following:

Application data.

Previous loan information.

Bureau data.

Demographic information.

Key Columns:

TARGET: 1 if the client defaulted on the loan, 0 otherwise.

Numerical and Categorical Features: Various socio-economic and loan-related details.

Installation
